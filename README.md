# Open-source nuke

## Democratizing nuclear energy!

*There must be no barriers to freedom of inquiry. There is no place for dogma in science. The scientist is free, and must be free to ask any question, to doubt any assertion, to seek for any evidence, to correct any errors.* â€”&nbsp;Julius&nbsp;Robert&nbsp;Oppenheimer
